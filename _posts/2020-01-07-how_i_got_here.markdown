My final project Cookbook was the most challenging project in FlatIron. It tested my resiliency, patience, and most of all, my  perseverance.  This project combined Riails API back-end and React/Redux. I started out on my backend buidling my control and creating my database. I kept my backend simple for this project, but plan on building out this app more in the future by creating categories and comments.

For the front end I had to pass these specific critieras: 

The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.
Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app
Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
There should be 2 container components
There should be 5 stateless components
There should be 3 routes

Working on the front end of this project proved to be the most difficult part. After going back and reviewing old labs and YouTubing concepts I was sitll confused about, I was ready to start building out my front end page. My goal was to build out react and redux at the end, where I will be dispatching and retriving props from the store. After I built out react, passing props and creating and updating the state, I decided to work on redux. I created actions, reducers, and promises. By building this out, I am able to create a new or updated copy of state. 

What I've learned from react/redux is that it's only about Thunk and the store. I am able to receive, maniuplate, and add with the help of store concept.
