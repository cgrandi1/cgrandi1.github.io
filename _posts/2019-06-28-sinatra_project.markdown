Creating the project, I had an idea in mind to create a psuedo investment portfolio that was intented for Venture Capitalists. So they can track their investments in a very user friendly forum. 

This project was a difficult one because there were so many layers, so may routes, and a lot of rendering. Because coding is so details, I felt like I was going through each of my view pages and route controllers with a fine-tooth comb. 

Luckily with having a local address, it tells where exactly the bug is coming from in your code. Even so, this project took truly test my patience. I don't think I've ever been so frustrated, yet determined to complete a project until this one. 

It was a great experience to have because it truly tested your level as a coder, and it also forced you to dilegent and detail-oriented. But most importantly, this test eaches you patience and how to deal with frustration. 


The  hang ups I had in this project started with helpers. After doing this project, understanding helpers was critical, because I knew where to use them and how to use them. Then after understanding the concept of helpers, understanding how to use routes and rendering erb files took me a little to processes. Thankfully, we had the project "FTwitter" to refer back to, but having this project gave you a deeper dive into how routes and erb files work. 

The view pages I thought were the most straight forward and I enjoyed doing that the most. I need to create shortcuts, because typing out in HTML everytime gets a little tedius. 

Overall, great project, took me approximaltey 5 days to complete, but glad I completed it!
