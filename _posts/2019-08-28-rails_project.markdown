The rails project was a test that required patience, logical thinking, belief, and will. The accumulation of everyting learned in the rails section was more daunting than I originally thought. 

I thought I was comfortable with associations; I thought I felt comfortable with "has_many", "belongs_to"; I thought I felt comfortable with with validations -- until this project tested me on all fronts. This was by far the most challenging project I'ver ever had, yet it was most rewarding/fun I've ever had doing a project.

Yes, I asked many questions, and yes, google ultimatley became my best friend -- but  seeing the once conceptualized project being materialized on the browser, was a feeling like a no other. But before I gush over how much this project pushed me, I would like to state the most challenging parts of this project: 

1) One of the more challenging things in this project was conceptualizing how you wanted your project to turn out, and actually understanding how join tables and associations work. Chaining on associations to foreign ids or primary keys was something I had to get use to. And understanding how belongs_to and how_many works in your project was something I was forced to become comfortable with. Because in order for your website to materalize, you needed to fundamentally understand these concepts.

2) Patience - this was a tough one for me. It seemed as if a new bug would occur and a new hurdle needed to be jumped. I did a lot of re-reading on old sections, a lot of google, and a lot of banging my head against the way. The whole point of the these projects is not just trying to find the answer, but by being comfortable with being uncomfortable. This was something I'm practicing on getting better at. It's okay that I don't remember everything, however, knowing how to find the answer is what makes a developer truly valuable. I was forced into learning how to google key terms better and to know what exactly I was looking for. I became better at it at the end, and like most things, it gets better with practive. 

Over all, loved the project. I'm not quite looking forward to knowing what's next, but i'll be ready when it does.
